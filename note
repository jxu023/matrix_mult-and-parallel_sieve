count cache misses for a particular element
vs
coutn cache misses for whoel matrix

try matlab code for matlab to C for matrix multiplication
see what their alg is .. .compare to cs211 

3B^2 < C

c = cij + aij*bij
this is 3 reads and 1 write, can't do away with the write 
without the register reuse but yeah that's not related to cache thing ..

why was it b^2/4 misses per block
	I think it was that a line was 4 or 3 doubles every 4 values 
	there is cache miss

experimentally find the length of a line by testing times to retrieve doubles from memory when retrieving x number of local doubles
